# Machine Learning Model Selection

Project investigates the best-performing classifier and regressor models for a given selection of datasets
* Experiment involves running classification/regression models on their corresponding selection of datasets 
* Performances of each model are improved using the hyperparameter search technique
* Classification model performances are evaluated based on F1 Score (F1), Precision (P), Recall (R) 
* Regressor model performances are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R2 Score, Mean Absolute error
* Experiment consists of 8 classification models, 7 regressor models, 10 classification datasets and 10 regressor datasets
* Results of these experiments are plotted, compared and summarized
* SVM performs best among classification models
* Neural Network, Random Forest and AdaBoost perform best as regressors 
* Time consumed for training was immense in both the cases 
* Concludes that it is always a compromise between Data Size, Resource Constraint and Prediction Power
